    sendfile on; # The sendfile directive enables the use of the operating system's sendfile mechanism to efficiently transmit files to clients. This can improve the performance of serving static files, as it allows Nginx to offload the file transmission to the kernel.

    # tcp_nopush on; # The tcp_nopush directive controls whether Nginx should use the TCP_CORK option to attempt to reduce the number of small packets sent to the client in cases where multiple small packets could be combined into a single packet. This can be beneficial for performance optimization, especially for serving large files.

    keepalive_timeout 65; # The keepalive_timeout directive defines the maximum amount of time in seconds that an idle client connection will be kept open. If a client makes a request and the response is sent within this timeout period, the connection will be kept open for potential additional requests. This is particularly useful to reduce the overhead of establishing new connections for each request.

    # gzip on; # The gzip directive enables response compression using the gzip compression algorithm. When this directive is enabled, Nginx will compress responses before sending them to clients that support gzip compression. This can significantly reduce the amount of data transferred over the network, improving loading times for clients with limited bandwidth.
